# Image-Encryption-Decryption-Tool
This is a simple image encryption and decryption tool that manipulates pixel positions to securely encode and decode images. The tool allows users to select an image, encrypt it by shuffling its pixels, and later decrypt it to restore the original image.

Features
✅ Pixel-Based Encryption – Randomly swaps pixel positions for encryption.
✅ Lossless Decryption – Restores the original image by reversing swaps.
✅ Preserves File Format – The encrypted and decrypted images retain the original format.
✅ User-Friendly Selection – Uses a file picker to select images easily.
✅ Automatic Naming – Saves files with encrypt_ and decrypt_ prefixes.

How It Works
1️⃣ Encrypt an Image – Select an image, encrypt it, and save it as encrypt_<original_filename> in the designated folder.
2️⃣ Decrypt an Image – Pick an encrypted image and restore it as decrypt_<original_filename>.
3️⃣ Exit Option – Easily exit the program when done.

Usage
Run the script and follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt images effortlessly.

📌 Perfect for learning about basic cryptography techniques using pixel manipulation!
